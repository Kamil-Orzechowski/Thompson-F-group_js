The aim of this mathematical project is to implement some calculations connected with *Thompson F group*
(for definition and details see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups).
An element of the group is internally represented as an array of vertices ("breakpoints") of the graph
of the corresponding unit interval homeomorphism.
Some functionalities concerning combinatorial group theoretical properties will be added,
as well as those connected with a tree diagram representation of group elements.
A simple user interface will appear later.
